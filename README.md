here you can find the code I used to make star / quasar cutouts
as well as a psf to model quasars!

There are Point Spread Function making codes for F160, F125, and F105 filters for Hubble Sapce Telescope data listed as 'psf105,' 'psf125,' and 'psf160,' respectively. 'Cutout' allows to user to input the coordinates for a source for closer inspection. This code was used for quasar modeling and background galaxy subtraction.
